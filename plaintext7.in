The ceremony that lasted one and a half hours, was witnessed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief guest of this year’s parade, Brazilian president Jair Messias Bolsonaro as President of India, Ram Nath Kovind took the salute. Cabinet ministers — home minister Amit Shah, foreign minister S Jaishankar and Human Resources development minister Ramesh Pokriyal — were among the audience alongwith top bureaucrats and diplomats of many countries.

The ceremonies this year was marked by several firsts – starting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi paying homage to soldiers killed in battle at National War Memorial instead of the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the India Gate where he was met by the newly appointed Chief of Defence Staff, Bipin Rawat, besides Indian Army chief Manoj Mukund Naravane, Navy Chief Karambir Singh and Air Force chief R.K.S. Bhadauria. The National War Memorial which was inaugurated in February last year by Modi, has been built in memory of the soldiers who laid down their lives for the country after independence.

Other firsts included a contingent of women bikers of paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force that performed daredevil stunts. It was led by Inspector Seema Nag who was seen saluting the president while balanced on a moving motorcycle.
