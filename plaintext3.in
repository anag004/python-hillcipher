Due to the ongoing French Revolution and subsequent exodus of French émigrés to Britain, the administration of William Pitt the Younger feared a "Jacobin uprising" aimed to overthrow Parliament and the King, and the widespread reach of the LCS and its pamphlets threatened a populist insurrection similar to what had been seen in France. What was most troubling about the LCS and societies like it were that they carefully operated within the law, meaning there was no legitimate reason for government interference in their activities. This tense climate resulted in infiltration of the LCS and other societies by government spies. These spies encouraged more radical societies to engage in potentially seditious activities, allowing the administration to paint them all as insurrectionists. As a result, the government was able to prosecute LCS members both for sedition and for their involvement with other societies potentially engaged in illegal activities. Ultimately, however, the LCS's popularity forced the government to rely on legislation to prevent the spread of the reform movement.
